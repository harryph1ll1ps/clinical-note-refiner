Doctor: Hi Sarah, come on in. How can I help today?

Patient: Hi doctor. I've been having headaches for the last couple of weeks.

Doctor: Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about them?

Patient: They're mostly on the left side of my head. It feels like a dull pressure rather than sharp pain.

Doctor: How often are you getting them?

Patient: Pretty much every day. Usually later in the afternoon.

Doctor: And how long do they tend to last?

Patient: A few hours usually.

Doctor: Any nausea or vomiting with them?

Patient: No vomiting. Occasionally I feel a bit sensitive to light.

Doctor: Any visual symptoms like flashing lights or blurred vision?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Any weakness, numbness, or trouble speaking?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Have you noticed anything that triggers them?

Patient: Stress definitely makes them worse. Work's been really busy lately.

Doctor: Anything that helps?

Patient: If I lie down or take Panadol it eases a bit.

Doctor: How much Panadol are you taking?

Patient: Two tablets, usually once a day.

Doctor: Any past history of headaches or migraines?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Any fevers or recent illnesses?

Patient: No.

Doctor: Alright, I'll check your blood pressure and do a quick neurological exam.

[Examination performed]

Doctor: Blood pressure is within normal range. Neurological exam is normal.

Patient: Okay.

Doctor: Based on what you've told me and the exam, this sounds most consistent with tension-type headaches. I'll go through some management options and when to come back if things change.
